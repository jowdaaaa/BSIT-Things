            <img src="Pictures/grandline.jpg" alt="error">
            <p>The Grand Line is an ocean route which wraps around the entire world, south of the North and East Blues and north of the South and West Blues. It is separated from the Blues on both the north and south ends by the Calm Belt. The Grand Line is split into two sections by the Red Line: the first section is known as Paradise and the second is known as the New World.<br><br>
            Reputed as the "pirate's graveyard," the sea and the islands possess a vast number of unpredictable phenomena that are not seen anywhere else in the world, many of which make sailing extremely difficult. Additionally, the Grand Line is home to the world's most powerful people and groups, including the Three Great Powers. Only one group, the Roger Pirates, has managed to fully sail across the Grand Line, and this achievement is what caused their captain Gol D. Roger to be labeled as the "Pirate King".<br><br>
            The Grand Line serves as the setting of most of the series, with almost everything since the Arabasta Saga being set in it.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-location-dot"></i> EAST BLUE</h2>
            <img src="Pictures/eastblue.jpg" alt="error">
            <p>The East Blue is an ocean in the Blue Sea and was the setting of the first six arcs of the manga and anime and the anime-only Warship Island Arc. The East Blue, like its sister seas, comprises almost entirely of ocean, with scattered islands and a border with the Red Line. It is also referred to as the Sea of Schemes.<br><br>
            The East Blue is commonly known as the weakest of all the seas. Pirates who are considered great and threatening in this sea are regarded as low rate compared to pirates from the other seas and especially in the Grand Line. Ironically, despite its poor fame, the East Blue was the birthplace of the most famous and powerful pirate of all time, the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger.<br><br>
            Many other powerful and world-renowned characters also hail from the East Blue: Marine hero and vice-admiral, Monkey D. Garp; pirates of the Worst Generation, Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro, as well as their crewmates Nami, a navigator, and Usopp, a sniper; and the Revolutionary Army leader, Monkey D. Dragon, and his right-hand man, Sabo. Other notable pirate crews from this sea include the Spade Pirates and the Barto Club.</p>

            <img src="Pictures/newworld.jpg" alt="error">
            <p>The New World refers to the second half of the Grand Line and is the main setting of the second half of One Piece. It is located between West and North Blue, and Fish-Man Island and the other side of Reverse Mountain. The only known people to have fully explored it are Gol D. Roger and his crew.<br><br>
            The New World is the second half of the Grand Line. It stretches from Mary Geoise to the other side of Reverse Mountain. The second half of the Grand Line is a whole “new world” of adventures beyond anything that one might face in the first half, it is such an abhorrent challenge that the first half of the Grand Line is referred to as "Paradise" when comparing it to the second half. According to former Warlord, Gecko Moria, one will lose everything one cherishes in the New World, something he personally experienced. He also claimed that one shall face what he calls "The Ultimate Nightmare" there, indicating it is a very dangerous place for even the most powerful and talented pirates like himself.<br><br>
            The four strongest pirates in the world, the Four Emperors, reside in the New World. The New World is also the current location of Marine Headquarters after it was relocated on Fleet Admiral Sakazuki's orders at the beginning of the new era after the Summit War of Marineford in order to better challenge the Four Emperors.</p>
