                <p>When it comes to storytelling, Eiichiro Oda’s flagship series, One Piece, is nothing short of a masterpiece. Since 1997, the pirate-filled shonen has grown into one of the greatest, most-beloved stories of all time. After so many years of adventure, comedy, and fantastic fight scenes, there is no shortage of fan-favorite narrative arcs to choose from within the series.</p><br>
                <p>For some fans, many of One Piece's best moments occur around the start of the show. Others claim that Monkey D. Luffy's adventures pick up steam as they go, resulting in higher-quality story arcs across the board during the series' second half. In reality, One Piece has been a massive success since its inception, and its best arcs are spread throughout the entirety of its impressive 25-year syndication.</p><br>
                <p><b style="color:red">Updated on May 2023</b> : One Piece has officially moved into what has been confirmed to be its final saga, placing Monkey D. Luffy within striking distance of his long-time goal — becoming the Pirate King. Because of these developments, more and more fans are reflecting upon the legacy left by each of the series' narrative arcs. While every one of these story arcs adds something to the series, there are a few that are still far superior to their peers.</p>

                    <p>Every great shonen journey starts somewhere, and for Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro, that somewhere is One Piece's Romance Dawn arc. During this brief arc (which comprises the show's first three episodes), Luffy makes his desire to become the Pirate King known far and wide, starting with his pink-haired acquaintance, Koby.</p><br>
                    <p>In addition to Luffy, viewers also receive their first glimpse of Roronoa Zoro during the Romance Dawn arc — the swordsman's iconic introduction in Shells Town is still a highlight of the series over two decades later. These massive character introductions get One Piece started on the perfect note, and for this reason alone, the Romance Dawn Arc deserves its laurels.</p>

                    <p>By the end of the Orange Town arc, Luffy and Zoro are introduced to two characters who go on to play major roles in One Piece's narrative: Nami and Buggy the Clown. The introduction of these two characters alone would cement this arc's place in One Piece history, but thanks to a few fun fights between the Straw Hat trio and the Buggy Pirates, it slots among the show's best.</p>

By the end of their struggle against Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Nami are all firmly committed to one another as friends.</p><br>
                    <p>Kuro's dastardly plan to annihilate the inhabitants of Syrup Village forces the town's loudmouthed sniper to spring to action. Because of his courage, the Straw Hat Pirates defeat one of the East Blue's most heinous pirate crews. Despite being a relatively short arc, the events of Syrup Village are substantial enough to justify a rewatch for even the most die-hard fans.</p>
